      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">What coronavirus means for the UK property market</h2>
      <p class="ml-3">2020 May 06</p>

      <h5 class="mt-5">Immediate Impact</h5>
      <h6 class="my-3">Drop in demand</h6>
      <p>Even before the lockdown restrictions were put in place, Zoopla reported a rapid decline in online browsing and registered demand since March 13th (when Boris Johnson asked the nation to work from home if you can). This bottomed out at around the end of March at a level that is -70% compared to activities as of March 1. Since then, browsing levels have recovered partially, more so than registered demand.</p>
      <p>However the severity of the drop is more of a “delay interest” rather than “stopped looking all together” as evident in the improving demand as we move closer to potential lockdown ease. In the recent Savills Global Market Sentiment Survey, only 10% of estate agents said 30%+ of their buyers have stopped looking.</p>
      <p>In the Prime Market, defined as the top 5 to 10%, Savills see their website traffic from w/c Apr 13 now back up pre-COVID levels, however this is mostly driven by a +38% increase from overseas viewers. New buyer registration at Savills is still much lower, although they see more robust recoveries in the country than London. Similarly, Zoopla notes demand recovering the most in Manchester and Liverpool.</p>

          <img class="resize" src="img/blog1_zoopla_fig3.png" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <h6 class="mt-5 mb-3">Activity brought to a Standstill</h6>
      <p>Zoopla reported new sales agreed are down 90% since early March, with the remaining agreed on viewings that either occurred prior to lockdown or in more limited cases, investors going ahead  post virtual viewing. With no clear date on lockdown being lifted, and the nature of pricing evidence being delayed, it's unlikely we will see concrete evidence in the next 2 months.</p>
      <p>Activity will take time to recover. Currently Zoopla is predicting a 50% drop in transaction in 2020 compared to 2019. Savills see a 37% - 50% drop for 2020, back to a similar level in 2021 and a 13% increase for 2022.</p>
      <h6 class="mt-5 mb-3">Seller Sentiment</h6>
      <p>Since lockdown, little new selling instructions are coming to the market. For those with existing selling instructions, only 6% are considering removing from the market or have already removed from the market according to the Savills Global Sentiment Survey. The remaining vendors are roughly split 50:50 between those leaving it at the same price, and those considering or already lowered the price.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-5">Driver for Medium to Longer Term Impact</h5>
      <p>It would be hard to assess the impact to house prices on a medium to longer term without first looking at the impact to the wider economy.</p>
